# Quick start

Hoi there! I see you’re taking this really seriously. Let’s talk serious then.

Starting the service is made easy with the help of one simple script. Please make sure you have [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

Before we begin, spin up your database. Oh wait, you know how to do that, right?

First of all what you have to do is install and build all the packages, to do so we run the install with:

```npm install && npm run build```

Then, you want to start the service as simple as that:

```npm run start```

Pretty easy, innit? 😏
