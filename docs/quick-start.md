# Quick start

Hoi there! I see you’re taking this really seriously. Let’s talk serious then.

Starting the service is made easy with the help of two scripts, one for development and one for production. Please make sure you have [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Also don't forget [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/#download-links) since it's all written with that.

First of all what you have to do is install all the packages, to do so we run the install with:

```npm install```

Then, you want to start the service for developers as simple as that:

```npm run dev```

In case you’re wondering “Ok, boomer. And now how do I run production?", don’t worry, we got you covered!😎 Just run this:

```npm run prod```

Pretty simple, innit? 😏
