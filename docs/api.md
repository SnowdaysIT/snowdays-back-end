# API Endpoints 

To access the documentation for the available GraphQL queries follow the link to your home: 

[```üè°/graphql```](http://localhost:1337/graphql)

On the side you'll find a tiny tab with all the queries' and mutation's documentation that you'll ever need (and it's even always up-to-date).
